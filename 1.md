Country: United States of America

State: Pennsylvania

City: Aliquippa

Date: 25th November 2023

Affected Organization: Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa (MWAA)

Threat Actor: Cyber Av3ngers

Map: <https://maps.app.goo.gl/4ceSYfaMXU5smDC96>

Type: SCADA

Targeted OEM: Unitronics

Threat actors took control of a booster station.

Matthew Mottes, the chairman of the board of directors for the MWAA, confirmed to KDKA-TV attributed the attack to the Iranian hacker group Cyber Av3ngers.

Mottes revealed that the attack was immediately detected. The impacted station monitors and regulates pressure for Raccoon and Potter Townships.

The Pro-Palestine group targeted a system produced by Unitronics, which is "software or has components that are Israeli-owned."

The image published by KDKA-TV suggests that threat actors took over a Unitronics Vision system.

On its Telegram channel, Cyber Av3ngers announced it had targeted several SCADA systems at Israel's water facilities. The group added that "every Equipment" Made In Israel" Is Cyber Av3ngers Legal Target.

Aliquippa Municipal Workers disabled the affected equipment and relied on backup methods to maintain water pressure in the communities.

"They did not get access to anything in our actual water treatment plant - or other parts of our system - other than a pump that regulates the pressure to elevated areas of our system," Matthew Mottes, the water authority's chairman, told BeaverCountaian.com. "This pump was on a different computer network, separated from our primary network, and is physically miles away."

Along with the pump, the compromised network also services several security cameras.

"The booster station did what it was supposed to. It sent an alarm and we took control manually."

Aliquippa is currently in the process of building a new, state-of-the-art water treatment plant but is still using its antiquated facility, which dates back nearly 90 years.

"Our plant was built in the 1930s by J&L Steel, and because it's so antiquated, most of our processes of treating water are still done manually," Mottes said. "So any cyber-attack like this could not affect the quality of our drinking water."

The cyber threat actors likely accessed the affected device---a Unitronics Vision Series PLC with a Human Machine Interface (HMI)---by exploiting cybersecurity weaknesses, including poor password security and exposure to the internet. To secure WWS facilities against this threat, CISA urges organisations to:

-   Change the Unitronics PLC default password---validate that the default password "1111" is not in use.
-   Require multifactor authentication for all remote access to the OT network, including from the IT network and external networks.
-   Disconnect the PLC from the open internet. If remote access is necessary, implement a Firewall/VPN in front of the PLC to control network access to the remote PLC. A VPN or gateway device can enable multifactor authentication for remote access even if the PLC does not support multifactor authentication. Unitronics also has a secure cellular-based long-haul transport device that is secure to their cloud services.
-   Back up the logic and configurations on any Unitronics PLCs to enable fast recovery. Become familiar with the process for factory resetting and deploying configurations to a device in the event of being hit by ransomware.
-   If possible, utilise a TCP port different from the default port TCP 20256. Cyber actors actively target TCP 20256 after identifying it through network probing as a port associated with Unitronics PLC. Once identified, they leverage scripts specific to PCOM/TCP to query and validate the system, allowing for further probing and connection. If available, use PCOM/TCP filters to parse out the packets.
-   Update PLC/HMI to the latest version provided by Unitronics.
