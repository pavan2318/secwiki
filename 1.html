<h2>Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa Cyber Incident</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>On November 25th, 2023, the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa (MWAA) in Pennsylvania, United States, experienced a cybersecurity incident. The threat actor group identified as Cyber Av3ngers took control of a booster station which monitors and regulates water pressure for Raccoon and Potter Townships.</p>

<h3>Incident Details</h3>
<p>Matthew Mottes, the chairman of the MWAA, confirmed that the attack was immediately detected and attributed to the Cyber Av3ngers, an Iranian hacker group. This group has announced their responsibility for the attack on their Telegram channel, declaring all Israeli-owned equipment a legitimate target.</p>

<h3>Impact and Response</h3>
<p>The attack did not compromise the main water treatment plant or most parts of the system. However, it affected a pump and several security cameras. Aliquippa Municipal Workers took measures to disable the affected equipment and relied on backup systems to maintain water pressure.</p>

<h3>Security Measures and Recommendations</h3>
<p>In response to the incident, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued several recommendations for securing water and wastewater systems against such cyber threats, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the default password on Unitronics PLCs.</li>
<li>Requiring multifactor authentication for all remote access.</li>
<li>Disconnecting PLCs from the open internet and using secure transport devices.</li>
<li>Backing up logic and configurations and being prepared for ransomware attacks.</li>
<li>Utilizing different TCP ports to avoid common cyber-attack strategies.</li>
<li>Updating PLC/HMI to the latest version provided by Unitronics.</li>
</ul>
